        <h1>Surprise!</h1>
            <p class="middle">Merry Christmas, love! I wanted to surprise you by showing off some of the things I've been learning at work. Ever since November 19, the other temps and I have been getting together daily to learn how to code in HTML and CSS through Codecademy. As I got more and more into it, I realized that I wanted to make your Christmas gift using a platform you're used to and something that would allow me to explore my new interest. I used Visual Studio Code to write the code and GitHub to deploy it. It's been really difficult keeping this a secret from you, but I wanted you to be surprised!</p>
            <img src="./121719github.png" class="img" alt="Github Logo" height="150">
            <p>Below are some instances where I tried to cover my tracks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whenever you would ask me how work was going, I would always say "uneventful". In reality, I would be working on the website or asking the NAS web developer questions.</li>
                <li>Sometimes I mentioned to you that I "have a meeting" and asked could we push lunch back. It was in fact a meeting but with the other temps for HTML and CSS practice.</li>
                <li>You found Codecademy on my laptop or in a google search and asked me what it was. I honestly can't remember my excuse, but I know it was very lame. You never pressed though, thankfully.</li>
                <li>I would immediately grab my phone if I saw any facebook messages pop up on my phone because I was asking your mom, Ms. Kim, and Ms. Kringel for orchestra resources.</li>
                <li>When you suggested weekly or twice a week sessions where we worked on HTML and CSS, I convinced you to teach me Javascript first since I was already familiar with HTML and CSS.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="middle">I hope you enjoyed this carefully crafted project! Merry Christmas &#128150</p><br>
