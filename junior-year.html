        <h1>Junior Year</h1>
        <p>Ms. Kringel gave a few of us permission to eat lunch in the orchestra room on A days, which is what really let us grow closer as friends. You always nagged me every day to "hurry up and finish eating" and I was *apparently* bossy with our duet sessions.</p>

            <p>Originally, I was supposed to play first violin and you were supposed to play second violin for our Penny Lane duet, but after realizing that I did not play out, Ms. Kringel switched us (which was a really good decision). We were stand partners this concert too!</p>

            <p>This was the concert where Daniel was introduced to Sinfonia No. 1, Movement 1. He would play, without fail, as soon as the bell to go to fourth block rang. It was also the second concert in a row that we got to play a duet together (technically a trio with Ben Powell). I played first violin and you were second violin, so at least we were balanced from the previous concert!</p>

            <p>District Assessment was simultaneously fun and stressful. While it was stressful because of the pressure to get superior ratings, it was so fun helping out backstage and seeing all of the other schools performing and connecting with past orchestra directors.</p>
