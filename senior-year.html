        <h1>Senior Year</h1>
        <p>This was our final year in high school orchestra. Eating lunch in the orchestra room was the most fun I had during high school because we were all good friends having a good time with each other. It was so emotional when we were all standing on the stage after Ms. Kringel gave us flowers and the orchestra played Autumn Vows for us.</p>

            <p>Senior Regional Orchestra was so fun despite a few hiccups, but you were concertmaster! We were directed under the wonderful Jorge Aguirre. Never will we forget "last time!"</p>

            <p>For our last Christmas concert ever, Ms. Kringel picked out good pieces like Themes from the Nutcracker. You always took her up on her offer to wear a Santa hat during the concert.</p>

            <p>Of Glorious Plumage was such a beautiful piece, especially when Andy played the solo. We were all given the chance to do so, but it was mutually agreed upon that he played it the best. Skylife was where you excelled, and where I fell short. You and Albert would often play riffs during lunch after Ms. Kringel gave you both sheet music of improv suggestions.</p>

            <p>It's worth noting that we won first place in the competition. However it is also worth noting that we only won first place because the other school didn't show up. But still, an accomplishment nonetheless!</p>

            <p>Our finale as the orchestra squad was Incantations. Even though we annoyed everybody during lunch by continually practicing it, it was such a blast to bring back our favorite piece from over the years. You, Tony, Seth, and I wanted to perform this long before the concert. Once we got Daniel, Derrick, and Albert on board it was perfect.</p>
