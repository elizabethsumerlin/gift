        <h1>Sophomore Year</h1>
        <p>This was such a fun year because our small chamber orchestra allowed us all to grow closer together. Although we still didn't talk much at this point, we will always have those shared memories.</p>

                </ul>
            <p>This was our first introduction to Plink, Plank, Plunk! You took a liking to this piece, though I heard Ms. Kringel say "Logan can you please stop plucking?" until the end of time. She made you put your violin under the chair at some point...</p>
            <h2>December 13, 2012</h2>

                 </ul>
            <p>It may be insignificant but it's kind of funny that Ms. Kringel literally cut out a section from the first violin part of Stille Nacht and TAPED it over our second violin part. </p>

                    <li>Symphony No. 38 "Prague"</li>
                </ul>
            <p>District Assessment was another fantastic example of how we were told to play some of the first violin part of Symphony No. 38 "Prague" because she wanted it to be heard more.</p>
            <h2>March 30, 2013: Carnegie Hall</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li>Symphony No. 38 "Prague"</li>
                </ul>
            <p>It was such an amazing experience to play at Carnegie Hall at just 15 years old. We also got to explore New York City as a group and ride the red velvet seated bus with PERSONAL OTTOMANS. You also showed me Flow on your iPod touch for the first time while we were on the bus, somewhere in NYC.</p>

                </ul>
            <p>We fell in love with Incantations during our spring concert. There was something about playing 16th notes as fast as humanly possible that absolutely fascinated us.</p>
