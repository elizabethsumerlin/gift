        <h1>Freshman Year</h1>
        <p>Since IB schedules were complex, we weren't able to take concert orchestra at the same time, but we still started our high school career doing what we loved, even though we didn't know each other yet.</p>

                </ul>
            <p>Roll your eyes all you want, but Geometric Dances was such an amazing pun. Square Dance was literally a fiddle tune for square dancing, Round Dance was played in a round with all the sections, and Triangle Dance had an actual TRIANGLE in it. Genius.</p>

            <p>These were some of the most classic Christmas pieces that eventually got turned into Strolling Strings holiday music. Modern Christmas Classics is one of my personal favorites still though, complete with the bells and glockenspiel (I think).</p>

            <p>Do you remember that one part of Rosamunde that was kind of dark and heavy but Ms. Kringel told us to play it light and bouncy? I still don't know if I ever got the hang of it...did you?</p>
